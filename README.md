## 🧱 The Story

Beneath the mountain roots, where even dwarves dare not dwell, lies the **Catacombs of Echoes** — a shifting crypt where the gods and the dead whisper in shapes.

You are the **Ritual Architect**, chosen to reshape the labyrinthine depths by fulfilling sacred patterns demanded by ancient voices. Each chamber you place brings you closer to silence… or collapse.

## 🕹️ Controls

|--------|---------|
| **Select & Place a Room** | Left Mouse Button |
| **Complete a Mission** | Left Mouse Button |
| **Cancel Room Selection** | Right Mouse Button |
| **Rotate Selected Room** | Mouse Wheel (if supported) |

## 🎮 How to Play

- Draw **Room cards** and place them adjacent to existing rooms.
- Align rooms to form specific **ritual patterns** — like crosses, lines, or corners.
- When a pattern is complete, it **vanishes**, scoring you points and clearing space.
- **Plan ahead**: if you run out of space or cards, your run ends.
- The longer you last, the **deeper** the descent… the more intricate the rituals.
