# 🕯️ Ridge Heart

*Built solo in 48 hours for [Ludum Dare 57](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/57)* by `Firellon`

**Theme:** *Depths*  
**Repository:** [github.com/Nebulate-me/LD57](https://github.com/Nebulate-me/LD57)


## 🧱 The Story

Beneath the wind-bitten peaks of the mountain ridge, a new dwarven kingdom is taking shape — forged not in war, but in stone and sweat.

You are the newly appointed **Architect of Ridge Heart**, entrusted with a modest stockpile of resources and the ambition to carve a legacy into the living mountain.

As your work begins, **tasks arrive from dwarven nobles, guildmasters, and deepfolk elders** — each demanding greater halls, longer corridors, and more elaborate constructions. The deeper and more complex the fortress becomes, the harder their requests.

But with every task fulfilled, your name earns respect — and more resources are granted to continue the great work.

**Plan wisely, carve efficiently, and see that Ridge Heart rises strong from the stone.**

## 🎮 How to Play

- Draw **Room Cards** and place them *adjacent* to existing rooms.
- Align rooms to form specific **Mission Patterns** — like crosses, lines, or corners.
- When a mission is complete, it will **highlight in gold** — click to complete it and earn new resources.
- **Plan ahead**: If you run out of cards with no way forward, your service ends (with dignity… or disgrace).
- The longer you endure, the **deeper** you go — and the more complex the tasks become.
